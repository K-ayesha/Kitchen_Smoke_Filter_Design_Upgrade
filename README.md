# Kitchen_Smoke_Filter_Design_Upgrade

## Our team worked on assisting a kitchen smoke filtration system to achieve a better filtration system. Initially, the idea was to design a new smoke filtration system for better performance than the existing design in an on-campus student dorm. But after careful revision of the situation, the team proposed to make use of the existing system, and using additional components to the system, we could still achieve the expected performance at the much lower expense as well as with a simplistic design for assembly.
