# Kitchen_Smoke_Filter_Design_Upgrade

### Our team worked on assisting a kitchen smoke filtration system. Initially, the idea was to design a new smoke filtration system in order to achieve better performance than the existing design in an on-campus student dorm. But after careful revision of the situation, the team proposed to make use of the existing system. Using additional components to the system, we still achieved the expected performance at a much lower expense as well as with a simplistic design for assembly.

A multitude of apartments, in particular dorms such as Hadley village apartment at University at BUffalo (North Campus), are lacking in ventilation from their existing filtration systems, and as such result in health issue and fire alarms being set off unnecessarily from the excessive smoke. Our focus was on apartments geared to college students as a small budget projects. But using the same ideas, the design can be modified for bigger kitchens and commercial apartment kitchens as well. 

The project was a year long effort, where the first part included reaching out people from different household size and family background to better understand customer expectations from a large range. The understanding of expectations was achieved using a survey analysis. While about 46% people uses kitchen smoke filter everyday, 38% says they face issues with their current system in various ways. 



So, clearly there were problems in kitchen smoke filtartion that needed to be addressed. 

we developed 25 prelimenary design idea, from which using QFD Matrix,
